# Flight-departure-delay-prediction

### Introduction

This project aims to predict the probability of a flight being delayed by more than 15 minutes based on feature such as Month, DayOfWeek, CRSDepTime, Origin, and Distance. A Bayesian logistic regression model is used to estimate how these features influence the likelihood of a delay. The model utilizes MCMC sampling to estimate the relationships between the predictors and the delay. This approach demonstrates the value of Bayesian methods in providing both predictions and uncertainty estimates, offering useful insights for airlines to improve operations and customer service.
