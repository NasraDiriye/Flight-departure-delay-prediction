# Flight-departure-delay-prediction

### Introduction

This project uses Bayesian inference to predict flight delays at PIT airport in 2006. The model considers features like month, day of the week, scheduled departure time, origin, and distance. By using MCMC sampling, it estimates the probability of a flight being delayed by more than 15 minutes and provides insights into the factors influencing delays, potentially aiding airlines in improving operations and customer service.
